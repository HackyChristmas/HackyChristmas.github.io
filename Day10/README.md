# Day 10

Today, we're putting more pieces together; we're building on what we looked at yesterday with using downloaded STL models, we're building on what we did previously with DXF files and using modules from other OpenSCAD files.

Try and make a fairground carousel. You know, [this](https://www.irvinleisure.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Carousel1-660x438.jpg) sort of thing.

You'll need a base, a roof, a middle bit (`cylinder`s?) and a bunch of things for people to ride on (animals like ducks and horses, maybe a vehicle or two like a `locomotive`).

Bonus points for decoration (maybe you can use `projection` to put animal shapes on the roof canopy?)
