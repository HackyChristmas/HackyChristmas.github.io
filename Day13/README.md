# Day 13

Ok, yesterday's thing was pretty boring because:
 - Firstly, it was a really simple object we looked at in the web page, and
 - Secondly, you didn't even get to create the object yourself

Today I'll try and get you looking at some of your own models in your browser.

Find a model that you've enjoyed working on this week (my favourite so far is the snowflake on [day 4](../Day04)), scale it to (roughly) fit in a 5mm cube, translate it so it sits on the origin and export an STL file (like we did [yesterday](../Day12)).

You'll be able to upload that file and view it with this webpage [here](viewer.html).
