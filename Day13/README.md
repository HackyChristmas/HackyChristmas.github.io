# Day 13

Ok, yesterday's thing was pretty boring because:
 - Firstly, it was a really simple object we looked at in the web page, and
 - Secondly, you didn't even get to create the object yourself

Today I'll try and get you looking at some of your own models in your browser.

Find a model that you've enjoyed working on this week (my favourite so far is the snowflake on [day 4](../Day04)) and export an STL file (like we did [yesterday](../Day12)).

We're going to use that file with the webpage [here](viewer.html).
