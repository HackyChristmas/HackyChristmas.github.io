# Day 1

Today's challenge consists of two parts:
 - Download and install OpenSCAD
 - Build a snowman

## Download and Install OpenSCAD

Head over to the OpenSCAD website, download the version of OpenSCAD for the type of computer you're using and install it (if the computer is not yours, you'll need permission - and possibly some help - to do this).

## Build a Snowman
